API – Application Programming Interface. It helps to connect two programs with each other using sets of definitions and protocols. 
There are fours ways to work with API:
 SOAP API – Simple Object Access Protocol. The client and server exchange messages via XML.
 RPC API - Remote Procedure Calls.  The client executes a function (or procedure) on the server, and the server sends the result back to the client.
 Websocket API. Uses JSON objects to transfer data and supports two-way communication between client applications and the server. 
 REST API - Representational State Transfer. The client sends requests to the server as data. The server uses this client input to run internal functions and returns output back to the client.
